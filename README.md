## Neural Network Development for Recognizing Handwritten Digits

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook project involves developing a neural network using Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes loading and visualizing the data, constructing a sequential model with multiple dense layers, and training this model on the MNIST training set while validating its performance on a test set. The model's architecture and training process are visualized and evaluated through accuracy plots for both training and validation data.
